          The witch is a special type of powerful 
          spell-caster.  Though similar to the magic-
          user, it is not a magic-user subclass, much 
          in the same way that the cavalier is similar 
          to (but not a subclass of) the fighter.  The 
          witch has talents and powers normally
          associated with other spell-casting classes,
          as well as its own unique abilities.
          Based upon the witch of fairy tale, myth,
          and fantasy, the class includes a number of
          distinctive abilities.  Witches use herbs for 
          healing and magic, somewhat in the 
          manner of druids (to which witches are distantly 
          related).  Witches combine cleric and 
          magic-user forms of magic, since they
          are essentially worshippers of forbidden
          religions (generally evil in nature, but not 
          always so).  

          They specialize in spells involving
          nature, the changing seasons, and
          sympathetic magic (i.e., magic based upon
          the similarities between a spell-casting
          ritual and the spell’s effect), and they are
          also very knowledgeable about
          enchantment/charm spells involving humans
          and humanoids. The manipulation
          and control of other beings is one of the
          hallmarks of witch magic—a necessary
          step on the way to achieving greater and
          greater power. Evil witches often specialize
          in curses and destructive spells.

          Witches gain new spells by performing
          ritual sacrifice and prayer to deities—
          usually demon princes, archdevils, or the
          current oinodaemon. If the deity is
          pleased, it sends a servant being to teach
          the witch a new spell appropriate to her
          level and ability. Because the witch must
          learn the new spell as a magic-user does,
          her chance to know each listed spell and
          her minimum and maximum number of
          spells per level are taken from Table II on
          page 10 of the <em>Player's Handbook</em>. 
          Witches always gain the spells <em>read magic</em> and
          write, not having to check for knowing
          these spells as they start in their class.

          Witches may use the latter two spells to
          learn the spells used by other spell-casting
          classes, so long as the spells learned are
          duplicated in the list of spells allowed to
          witches, and so long as the witch is of a
          level appropriate to the spell. For instance,
          a 4th-level witch who has found a scroll
          with the 2nd-level cleric spell <em>find traps</em>
          may attempt to learn the spell directly
          from the scroll, copying it down (in her
          own magical language) for future use. All
          witches keep and use spell books, from
          which they relearn their spells as do
          magic-users (see page 40, “Recovery of
          spells,” in the DMG, and pages 79-80 in
          Unearthed Arcana).

          If a Dungeon Master desires a witch
          with more variety, the restrictions on
          which spells may be learned by witches
          may be loosened. Spells that summon
          beings from the lower planes and bind
          them to certain tasks are not likely to be
          taught to a witch by her deity’s servants
          (whether they are evil or good), but nothing
          should stop the witch from looking up 
          witches who did not join a High
          Secret Order (see below) are the ones most
          likely to make use of such spells — so long
          as the witches do not use them to attempt
          to bind their own deity. Other spells, particularly
          those from <em>Unearthed Arcana</em>,
          may be added as well (see the general
          notes on spells below).

          There are two orders of witches. Low
          Order Witches may progress to 16th level,
          and High Secret Order Witches may advance
          to 22nd level. Witches may be of
          any alignment, though evil witches are the
          rule; good and neutral witches are almost
          unknown. The prime requisites for a
          witch are intelligence and wisdom, each of
          which must be 13 or higher. Only humans,
          elves (any sub-race from <em>Unearthed Arcana</em>),
          and half-elves can he witches; furthermore,
          only humans and dark elves
          (drow) can be members of a High Secret
          Order. Other elves and all half-elves are
          limited to no higher than 11th level as
          witches, but no male witch of any race can
          rise higher than 9th level. No witch may
          be multiclassed or double-classed, due to
          the difficulties involved in learning and
          maintaining one’s magical powers. No
          earned bonus to experience is gained for
          exceptional ability scores.

          Most witches are female, since this class
          attracts a disproportionate number of
          female humans, elves, and half-elves to its
          practice. This situation is encouraged by
          the large number of evil male beings ruling
          the Lower Planes, most of whom desire
          mortal consorts, and by female deities
          (of any alignment) governing magic, who
          find worshipers among women in oppressive,
          male-dominated societies. Male
          witches are sometimes called warlocks,
          though this term invites confusion with
          the level title for 8th-level magic-users.
          Conversely, many female magic-users are
          improperly called witches. As a generic
          term for a single witch, the pronoun “she”
          is used in this text.

          Witches have 4-sided hit dice and receive
          1 hit die for each level of experience
          up to and including 11th level. Thereafter,
          they each receive one additional hit point
          for each level of experience — 11+1 for  
          12th level, 11+2 for 13th level, and so on.
          Witches receive constitution bonuses as do
          magic-users, and they save either as
          magic-users or as clerics, on whichever
          column is better against a given effect.
          Weapon proficiencies, allowable weapon
          types, attack tables used, and attacks per
          round are all as per magic-users. They
          may wear no armor whatsoever, save for
          magical protections such as rings, bracers,
          cloaks, etc., and witches cannot use
          shields. They may use any magical item
          that magic-users are able to employ. Oil
          may be used as a weapon (though it rarely
          is), and poison is freely used by evil
          witches

          Witches with above-average intelligence
          receive bonus spells, similar to the procedure
          for a cleric with above-average wisdom:
